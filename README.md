# Rails 3 Quickstart Template

This Rails 3 template will get you up and running with Mongoid, Devise, Formtastic, Factory Girl, HTML5, jQuery and Heroku.

It will also setup a basic application template with 1kb grid and flutie. 

Throughout the install, you will be asked some questions to setup your app.

## Usage

  rails new app_name -m http://github.com/cwsaylor/rails3-quickstart/raw/master/templates/rails3.rb

or if you'd rather not use MongoDB:

  rails new app_name -m http://github.com/cwsaylor/rails3-quickstart/raw/master/templates/rails3.rb -d mysql
  
And then answer "n" to "Use Mongoid? y/n"

## Thanks

I would like to thank Daniel Kehoe for the awesome Rails 3 template tutorial:
